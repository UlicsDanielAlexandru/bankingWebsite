bankingWebsite

This project represents a website that incorporates the needed operation of an online
banking application. It has two principal interfaces for the possible types of users:
normal users and admins. Admins have the capabilities to modify certain aspects of
the database directly from the website, like adding and modifying users, while also
keep track of all the transactions. Normal clients can view their personal information,
as well as make transactions to other accounts. This project was done using Java, Spring, HTML/CSS, Thymeleaf, and others.
